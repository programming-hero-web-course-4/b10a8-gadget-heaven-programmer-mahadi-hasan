## React Fundamentals
- **Components**: Used to build reusable UI components for different parts of the website.
- **State Management**: Managed the state of various components using the `useState` hook.
- **Effect Hook**: Used `useEffect` to handle side effects in the application.
- **Context API**: Implemented Context API for global state management, making it easier to manage and share state across components.
- **Routing**: Used `react-router-dom` for client-side routing to manage different pages and navigation within the app.

## Data Handling and Management
For handling and managing data, we have used the **Context API**. The Context API allows us to create a global state that can be accessed and modified from any component in the app, providing a seamless and efficient way to manage state across the application.

### Context API Highlights
- **Cart Management**: Handles adding, removing, and sorting items in the cart.
- **Wishlist Management**: Manages the wishlist, ensuring no duplicates and easy access to favorite items.
- **Total Price Calculation**: Dynamically updates the total price based on items in the cart.
